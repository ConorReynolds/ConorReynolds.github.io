Readability above all&amp;mdash;following Matthew Butterick&amp;rsquo;s example in his Practical Typography web book. One should be able to read the text from start to finish with minimal distractions. Do you know what I find distracting? Horrible blue underlined text. This is design 101: if you want people to notice something, just make it look disgusting.
Styling links in this way is common, but is mercifully becoming less common.</description></item></channel></rss>
