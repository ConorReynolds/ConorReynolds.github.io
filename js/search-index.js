  "body": `Conor Reynolds PhD Student & Formal Methods Researcher I am a PhD student at Maynooth University. My research interests include the theory of institutions, the Coq proof assistant, the Eventâ€‘B formal modelling tool, and formal software design in general. Iâ€™m working on formalising the theory of institutions in Coq, with the institution for Eventâ€‘B as a primary use-caseâ€”supervised by Dr Rosemary Monahan. Funded by the Irish Research Council The formalisation is open source and available on my GitHub. Publications The following is pulled from my Zotero account directly from their API.

Institutions are based on category theory and have deep roots in a well-developed branch of algebraic specification. However, there are no machine-assisted proofs of correctness for institution-theoretic constructionsâ€”chiefly satisfaction conditions for institutions and their (co)morphismsâ€”making them difficult to incorporate into mainstream formal methods. This paper therefore provides the details of our approach to formalizing a fragment of the theory of institutions in the Coq proof assistant. We instantiate this framework with the institutions FOPEQ for first-order predicate logic and EVT for the Event-B specification language, both of which will serve as an illustration and evaluation of the overall approach.}, booktitle = {Theoretical {Aspects} of {Software} {Engineering}}, publisher = {Springer International Publishing}, author = {Reynolds, Conor and Monahan, Rosemary}, editor = {AÃ¯t-Ameur, Yamine and CrÄƒciun, Florin}, year = {2022}, pages = {180â€“196}, } Formalizing the Institution for Event-B inÂ the Coq Proof Assistant .

We present the two challenges that we tackled during the competition and discuss our solutions. As a result, we identify strengths and weaknesses of Dafny in the verification of relatively complex algorithms, and report on our experience of applying Dafny in this setting.}, urldate = {2022-05-16}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 23rd {ACM} {International} {Workshop} on {Formal} {Techniques} for {Java}-like {Programs}}, publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery}, author = {Farrell, Marie and Reynolds, Conor and Monahan, Rosemary}, month = jul, year = {2021}, keywords = {Dafny, Deductive Verification, Verification Challenges, VerifyThis}, pages = {32â€“38}, }`,
