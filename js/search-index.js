Institutions are based on category theory and have deep roots in a well-developed branch of algebraic specification. However, there are no machine-assisted proofs of correctness for institution-theoretic constructions—chiefly satisfaction conditions for institutions and their (co)morphisms—making them difficult to incorporate into mainstream formal methods. This paper therefore provides the details of our approach to formalizing a fragment of the theory of institutions in the Coq proof assistant. We instantiate this framework with the institutions FOPEQ for first-order predicate logic and EVT for the Event-B specification language, and define some institution-independent constructions, all of which serve as an illustration and evaluation of the overall approach.}, urldate = {2023-11-30}, journal = {Science of Computer Programming}, author = {Reynolds, Conor and Monahan, Rosemary}, month = mar, year = {2024}, pages = {103054}, } FRETting and Formal Modelling: A Mechanical Lung Ventilator .

The theory has expanded since the ‘80s to encompass and relate a wide range of concrete logical systems. But inducting particular logical systems into the theory can be tiresome—often straightforward, but repetitive, technical, and prone to error. Worse, such work suffers from the very problem which motivates abstraction: we find ourselves proving the same things over and over again. In this thesis we will describe a framework for easing the process of constructing institutions and verifying their properties. The goal is primarily to expedite the verification of those proof obligations most commonly involved in constructing institutions. We start by encoding the institution for first-order predicate logic, turning later to the semantics for the Event-B modelling method. We then explore a particular logic combination of Event-B and linear temporal logic, as well as some interesting institution-independent constructions that enable generic logic combinations and translations—all of which will serve as useful work in its own right, but also as a demonstration of the framework.}, language = {English}, school = {Maynooth University}, author = {Reynolds, Conor}, year = {2023}, note = {Publisher: National University of Ireland Maynooth}, keywords = {coq, institutions}, } 2022 Machine-Assisted Proofs for Institutions in Coq .

Pronounced ‘smack it’. I think all conference names should be this amusing. I’m the web chair (that is, I made the website) for iFM 2024 . It’s built using Pollen , same as this site. PhD Thesis Supervised by Prof Rosemary Monahan, I put institution theory in the Rocq Prover . Formerly known as the Coq proof assistant. You can read about the name change on their website . You can see it on GitHub . Institution theory studies logical systems in general using category theory. An institution is a mathematical object which is supposed to approximate a ‘logical system’, and so by studying institutions we hope to study logical systems in general. I encoded some of the general theory of institutions in Rocq and (more significantly) instantiated the theory to a few concrete logics, mostly first-order logic and its variants. I also constructed a trace semantics for Event-B as an institution and combined it with linear temporal logic as a duplex construction. This sounds a lot fancier than it is, but it’s still neat.
