  "body": `Conor Reynolds PhD Student & Formal Methods Researcher I am a PhD student at Maynooth University. My research interests include the theory of institutions, the Coq proof assistant, the Eventâ€‘B formal modelling tool, and formal software design in general. Iâ€™m working on formalising the theory of institutions in Coq, with the institution for Eventâ€‘B as a primary use-caseâ€”supervised by Dr Rosemary Monahan and funded by the Irish Research Council. The formalisation is open source and available on my GitHub. Publications The following is pulled from my Zotero account. See the source repo for details on how this is generated.

Institutions are based on category theory and have deep roots in a well-developed branch of algebraic specification. However, there are no machine-assisted proofs of correctness for institution-theoretic constructionsâ€”chiefly satisfaction conditions for institutions and their (co)morphismsâ€”making them difficult to incorporate into mainstream formal methods. This paper therefore provides the details of our approach to formalizing a fragment of the theory of institutions in the Coq proof assistant. We instantiate this framework with the institutions FOPEQ for first-order predicate logic and EVT for the Event-B specification language, both of which will serve as an illustration and evaluation of the overall approach.}, booktitle = {Theoretical {Aspects} of {Software} {Engineering}}, publisher = {Springer International Publishing}, author = {Reynolds, Conor and Monahan, Rosemary}, editor = {AÃ¯t-Ameur, Yamine and CrÄƒciun, Florin}, year = {2022}, pages = {180â€“196}, } Formalizing the Institution for Event-B inÂ the Coq Proof Assistant .

  "title": `About This Site`,
  "body": `About This Site Pollen + Makefile = all you need This site is built using Pollen, an incredibly flexible tool for creating web books. To oversimplify: Pollen source files are fed in, written in a markup language of oneâ€™s own design, and HTML is spat out. Itâ€™s like LaTeX for the webâ€”but where LaTeX is a giant macro preprocessor, Racket is a modern programming language. This site is open source, so feel free to have a dig around to see how it works. Instead of explaining in detail exactly what makes Pollen great, Iâ€™ll provide an example of how I use it. I wanted to list my publications on the front page of my site. I also wanted to automate this process, since the job of curating such a list by hand is initially tedious and eventually forgotten outright. I maintain a list of my publications on my Zotero account. In the past I used BibBase to present this information on my site, but found that it was extremely finicky to style to my liking, and very slow to load. For longer lists the wait becomes nearly unbearable. I eventually got sick of this and decided to generate the information at compile time with a small Racket script. The source for the home page looks something like this: 1 2 3 4 5 â—Šsection{Publications} The following is pulled from my Zotero account. â—Šaside{See the â—Šextlink[ " https://github.com/ConorReynolds/ConorReynolds.github.io/blob/main/src/zotero.rkt " ]{source repo} for details on how this is generated.} â—Š(cons @ â—Š(bib-items)) The function bib-items is defined in src/zotero.rkt . It pulls my publications directly from Zoteroâ€™s API and constructs a list of divs that I can splice into the document. This is done at compile time, so a user visiting the page just sees plain HTML. And thatâ€™s it! It loads faster, itâ€™s easier to customise, and it provides almost as much automationâ€”all for a meagre fraction of the time I spent tweaking BibBase. Though, if this isnâ€™t your cup of tea, I would still highly recommend BibBase as an alternative. Full-Text Search The site comes with non-fuzzy full-text search. This was a feature that I created for another project Iâ€™m working on, but it works for any(?) Pollen-generated website, so I figured Iâ€™d add it for fun. Itâ€™s basically a thin wrapper over elasticlunr and is very barebones, but itâ€™s fast and gets the job done.`,
