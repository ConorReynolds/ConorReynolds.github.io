## Abstract

We formalize a fragment of the theory of institutions sufficient to establish basic facts about the institution for Event-B, and its relationship with the institution *FOPEQ* for first-order predicate logic. We prove the satisfaction condition for *EVT* and encode the institution comorphism *FOPEQ* → *EVT* embedding *FOPEQ* in *EVT*.
