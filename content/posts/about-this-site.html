<h1>About This Site</h1>

<div id="doc"><p>This isn’t any­thing like a tuto­r­ial or a com­pre­hen­sive ref­er­ence—it’s just a dump of some of the tools, resources, and thought-processes that went into build­ing this site, in case it would be help­ful to any­one. I update this pretty often, depend­ing on how the imple­men­ta­tion details for the site change.</p><h2>Fonts</h2><p>I went with Char­ter. I con­verted the <a class="extlink" href="https://ctan.org/pkg/xcharter">XChar­ter</a> OTF fonts to WOFF2, then base64-encoded them and baked them into my CSS. I went with XChar­ter rather than <a class="extlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Charter">Bit­stream Char­ter</a> because it has an extended char­ac­ter set and more font vari­ants—includ­ing small-caps, which I use for cross-ref­er­ences. With­out a prop­erly designed small-caps font, browsers will just scale down reg­u­lar cap­i­tals as a sub­sti­tute. It looks awful.</p><p>The PDF ver­sions are type­set in Matthew But­t­er­ick’s <a class="extlink" href="https://mbtype.com/fonts/equity/"><em>Equity</em>.</a></p><h2>Tool</h2><p>I went with Hugo. Why? Not sure. Looked good, fig­ured I’d give it a shot. I quite like it now. I host on Git­Hub because it’s free and because it’s linked to my pro­fes­sional Git­Hub account where I host my projects. It’s easy to set up a redi­rect from my <a class="extlink" href="https://www.cs.nuim.ie/~creynolds">depart­ment site</a> (don’t click that). If I change depart­ments I can just keep set­ting up redi­rects to here. And if Git­Hub Pages dies for some rea­son, I can move it eas­ily.</p><h2>Colour Schemes</h2><p>As of 2022-05-25, this site respects the user’s pref­er­ence for light or dark mode. The sup­port for dark mode is cur­rently a <em>bit</em> pre­lim­i­nary, but it should look mostly fine.</p><h2>How I Write Posts</h2><p>I pre­process every­thing with the <a class="extlink" href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/">Pollen pub­lis­ing tool</a> before I push the site live. I’ve never been a huge fan of Mark­down. There are plenty of excel­lent crit­i­cisms of Mark­down else­where—suf­fice it to say that, for me, it’s far too lim­ited. Hugo’s short­codes go some way to cir­cum­vent­ing its lim­i­ta­tions, but it’s not really enough. Pollen, how­ever, lets me write exactly how I want. I can also use it to gen­er­ate La­TeX code, mean­ing that each blog post writ­ten in Pollen gets a PDF ver­sion for free. You can see this one <a class="extlink" href="/posts/about-this-site.pdf">here.</a></p><p>The site is open source and avail­able <a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/ConorReynolds/ConorReynolds.github.io">on my Git­Hub,</a> if you want to see how it works.</p><h2>Asides</h2><p>The PDF ver­sions of the posts get side­notes, but on the web you instead get a nice lit­tle but­ton. <span class="tooltip" onclick="this.classList.toggle(&quot;show-tooltip&quot;)">+<span class="tooltip-inner">Cool, right? Well, unless you’re read­ing this on a PDF, then it’s a lit­tle less cool.</span></span></p><h2>SASS</h2><p>SASS is a really nice CSS exten­sion lan­guage. The only prob­lem is that VS Code <em>really</em> doesn’t like Hugo’s tem­plat­ing code hang­ing out in my SCSS files. This is annoy­ing mainly because it inter­feres with auto­com­ple­tion. My approach is just to avoid Hugo’s tem­plat­ing in SASS alto­gether—it doesn’t really make that much sense that styling infor­ma­tion should live in a <code>con­fig.toml</code>.</p><h2>TypeScript</h2><p>Hugo <em>also</em> lets me use Type­Script. For <a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.74.0">recent Hugo builds</a>, this is as easy as pip­ing a TS file through <code>js.Build</code>. I try to keep the JS to a min­i­mum because I find it really annoy­ing. The only JS on this site that I’ve writ­ten is the code imple­ment­ing the font-size but­tons, and some minor tweaks. The exter­nal JS comes from Bib­Base on the <a class="crossref" href="/">home</a> page or the Math­Jax on maths-enabled pages. If you have JS dis­abled, the Bib­Base infor­ma­tion will be replaced with an iframe. The only thing that def­i­nitely won’t work is the math­e­mat­ics.</p><h2>External Stuff</h2><p>This web­site relies on <a class="extlink" href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font­Awe­some</a> for the icons in the footer, <a class="extlink" href="https://bibbase.org/">Bib­Base</a> for the front-page, and <a class="extlink" href="https://www.mathjax.org/">Math­Jax</a> on maths-enabled pages. The Bib­Base script addi­tion­ally adds <a class="extlink" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Boot­strap.</a> I’d rather it didn’t, but I don’t think there’s much I can do.</p><p>The tem­plate I based this site on, <a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher">hugo-researcher,</a> used Boot­strap. I fig­ured it would be a <em>huge</em> pain to remove that depen­dency, but it was actu­ally far eas­ier than expected. This isn’t a com­pli­cated site, there’s no good rea­son to use Boot­strap.</p><h3>BibBase</h3><p>This gen­er­ates a list of my pub­li­ca­tions on my home­page from a Zotero col­lec­tion. Pretty use­ful! I had to heav­ily mod­ify some of the CSS to get it to gel with the rest of the site. <span class="tooltip" onclick="this.classList.toggle(&quot;show-tooltip&quot;)">+<span class="tooltip-inner">If you want to know what I changed then you can take a look at the source for this site—specif­i­cally, take a look at <a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/ConorReynolds/ConorReynolds.github.io/blob/main/assets/sass/style.scss"><code>assets/sass/style.scss</code></a></span></span> If you have Boot­strap included, then the script is <em>sup­posed</em> to detect that and not include its own ver­sion. My expe­ri­ence is that this is unre­li­able. So, if you’re using the script embed—<a class="extlink" href="https://bibbase.org/documentation">which is rec­om­mended</a>—then make sure to include the option <code>css=[link to your boot­strap]</code> in the URL. This should force Bib­Base to detect that you already have Boot­strap.</p><h3>MathJax</h3><p>This is the only thing that def­i­nitely won’t work with­out Java­Script. Here’s an exam­ple (<a class="extlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy's_integral_formula">Cauchy’s inte­gral for­mula</a>) so you can see what it looks like with and with­out JS.</p><p>\begin{align*}
  f(a) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\gamma} \frac{f(z)}{z - a}\, \mathrm{d}z
\end{align*}</p><h2>Accessibility</h2><p>I’ve tried to design most of the site with acces­si­bil­ity in mind, but I’m far from an expert at this. If you spot any glar­ing issues then please feel free to <a class="extlink" href="mailto:conor.reynolds@mu.ie">email me</a> and I’d be happy to fix them. There’s some more mus­ing on this in the <a class="crossref" href="/posts/hyperlinks">hyper­links</a> arti­cle.</p></div>
