I am a PhD student at [Maynooth University](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/). My research interests include the [theory of institutions](https://iep.utm.edu/insti-th/), the [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/), the [Event-B formal modelling tool](http://www.event-b.org/), and formal software design in general.

I'm working on formalising the theory of institutions in Coq[^1], with the institution for Event-B[^2] as a primary use-case---supervised by [Dr Rosemary Monahan](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/people/rosemary-monahan). The formalisation is open source and available [on my GitHub](https://github.com/ConorReynolds/coq-institutions).
