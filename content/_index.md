I am a PhD student at {{< extlink "Maynooth University" "https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/" >}}. My research interests include the {{< extlink "theory of institutions" "https://iep.utm.edu/insti-th/" >}}, the {{< extlink "Coq proof assistant" "https://coq.inria.fr/" >}}, the {{< extlink "Event&#8209;B formal modelling tool" "http://www.event-b.org/" >}}, and formal software design in general.

I'm working on formalising the theory of institutions in Coq[^1], with the institution for Event&#8209;B[^2] as a primary use-case---supervised by {{< extlink "Dr Rosemary Monahan" "https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/people/rosemary-monahan" >}}. The formalisation is open source and available {{< extlink "on my GitHub" "https://github.com/ConorReynolds/coq-institutions" >}}.
