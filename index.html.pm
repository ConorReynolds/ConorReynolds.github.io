I was a postdoc at the ◊extlink["https://www.manchester.ac.uk/"]{University of Manchester} working on a variety of things. I'm part of the ◊extlink["https://autonomy-and-verification.github.io/"]{Autonomy and Verification group}.

I spent my PhD encoding the ◊extlink["https://iep.utm.edu/insti-th/"]{theory of institutions} in the ◊extlink["https://rocq-prover.org/"]{Rocq Prover}. ◊aside{Formerly known as the Coq proof assistant. You can read about the name change ◊extlink["https://rocq-prover.org/about#Name"]{on their website}.} (It's all ◊extlink["https://github.com/ConorReynolds/coq-institutions"]{on GitHub}.) There are six or so concrete logics encoded there as of this writing, depending on how you count it.

I wrote lots of teaching resources while I was a PhD student at ◊extlink["https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/"]{Maynooth}. You can see a small selection of them ◊xref["resources.html"]{here}.
