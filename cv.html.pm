My publications are on the â—Šxref{home page}, if you're looking for those. Some other things I'm doing or have done:

    I'm on the program committee for â—Šextlink["https://smcit-scc.space/"]{IEEE SMC-IT 2024}. â—Šaside{Pronounced 'smack it'. I think all conference names should be this amusing.}

  â—Šitem{
    I'm the web chair (that is, I made the website) for â—Šextlink["https://ifm2024.cs.manchester.ac.uk/"]{iFM 2024}. It's built using â—Šextlink["https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/"]{Pollen}, same as this site.

â—Šsection-ruled{PhD Thesis}

Supervised by Prof Rosemary Monahan, I put â—Šextlink["https://iep.utm.edu/insti-th/"]{institution theory} in the â—Šextlink["https://coq.inria.fr/"]{Coq proof assistant}. You can see it â—Šextlink["https://github.com/ConorReynolds/coq-institutions"]{on GitHub}.

Institution theory studies logical systems in general using category theory. An institution is a mathematical object which is supposed to approximate a 'logical system', and so by studying institutions we hope to study logical systems in general.

I encoded some of the general theory of institutions in Coq and (more significantly) instantiated the theory to a few concrete logics, mostly first-order logic and its variants. I also constructed a trace semantics for Event-B as an institution and combined it with linear temporal logic as a duplex construction. â—Šaside{This sounds a lot fancier than it is, but it's still neat.}
