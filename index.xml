Readability is first and foremost&amp;mdash;following Matthew Butterick&amp;rsquo;s advice in his Practical Typography web book. One should be able to read the text from start to finish with minimal distractions. Do you know what I find distracting? Horrible blue underlined text. This is design 101: if you want people to notice something, just make it look disgusting.
It&amp;rsquo;s distracting. It&amp;rsquo;s really distracting. Now that might be all right if your webpage is a glorified link dump.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://ConorReynolds.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ConorReynolds.github.io/contact/</guid><description>The best way to contact me is by email at conor.reynolds@mu.ie. My social links, if you can call them that, extend only as far as a GitHub account and a GitLab account. Should my mind become sufficiently fevered, my judgement sufficiently impaired&amp;mdash;I might make a write-only Twitter account.</description></item><item><title>CV</title><link>https://ConorReynolds.github.io/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ConorReynolds.github.io/cv/</guid><description>Still working on it!
