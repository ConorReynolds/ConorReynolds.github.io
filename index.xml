Fonts I went with Charter. I converted the XCharter OTF fonts to WOFF2, then base64-encoded them and baked them into my CSS. I went with XCharter rather than Bitstream Charter because it has an extended character set and more font variants&amp;mdash;including small-caps, which I use for cross-references.</description></item><item><title>Whatâ€™s with the Hyperlinks?</title><link>https://ConorReynolds.github.io/posts/hyperlinks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 16:57:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ConorReynolds.github.io/posts/hyperlinks/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s with the Hyperlinks? Readability above all&amp;mdash;following Matthew Butterick&amp;rsquo;s example in his Practical Typography web book. One should be able to read the text from start to finish with minimal distractions. Do you know what I find distracting? Horrible blue underlined text. This is design 101: if you want people to notice something, just make it look disgusting.
Styling links in this way is common. That might be all right if your webpage is a glorified link dump (nothing wrong with that).</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://ConorReynolds.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ConorReynolds.github.io/contact/</guid><description>The best way to contact me is by email at conor.reynolds@mu.ie.
